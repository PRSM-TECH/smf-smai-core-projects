# 🤖 Ethical Multi-Agent AI Simulation (Water Allocation)

A fairness-driven simulation built under the SoulMindFusion initiative, where autonomous agents (villages) negotiate for limited resources (water) using an ethical logic inspired by priority, fairness, and karma.

---

## 🧭 Objective

* Allocate limited water fairly across multiple agents
* Use **karma logic** to reward selfless behavior
* Repeat across rounds to simulate **ethical evolution**

## ⚙️ Tools Used

| Tool   | Purpose                            |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Python | Simulation engine                  |
| JSON   | Logging allocation per round       |
| Karma  | Score that affects future priority |

## 🧠 Core Features

* 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Multi-agent interaction
* 💧 Water demand vs ethical compromise
* 🔁 Multi-round negotiation
* 📒 Log files per round for audit trails

## 🧩 Karma Logic Summary

| Behavior                      | Karma Impact |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ |
| Full sacrifice (0L allocated) | +2           |
| Partial allocation            | +1           |
| Exact match with need         | 0            |
| Greedy (takes excess)         | -1           |

Karma is **carried into next rounds**, influencing turn order and fairness weight.

## 🌿 Alignment with SoulMindFusion

* No agent exploits others for gain
* Encourages compromise and long-term harmony
* Prioritizes ethical design and transparency

> This simulation acts as a **sandbox for AI decision-making ethics**, ready to scale into resource allocation, group voting, and multi-agent collaborations.
